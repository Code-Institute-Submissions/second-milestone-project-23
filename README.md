# MOVEMENT

It's part of our human nature to want to explore the world that we live in. Most people go on holiday abroad at least once a year. 
Those who are single or retired travel even more. That is no different for us christians. Most christians have at some point in their 
life wanted to go on a mission trip. Some people want to just experience the life of a missionary as a one off thing and see the work of 
somebody they are either supporting or have heard about, others want to try it out and see if the missionary lifestyle is for them or not 
and if it's something that God has called them to do. 

In this project I've created a website that provides services like this, where individuals/couples/families can experience life in the 
mission field all from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. 

## UX

The website offers different kinds of mission trips depending on what the individual/couple/family is looking for as well as for how long 
they want to go for. There are four different destinations being offered with different trip lengths as well as different types of trips. 
This website targets everyone from creative people who want to use dance and drama as a missions platform; youth groups looking to do work
with other youths or young children, and those who are interested in going around preaching and giving testimonies in different churches.


### Website Goals 

- To gain an increase in website user activity, online enquiries and direct contact with the company

- To provide an easy navigational website for all kinds of users, that is clear and looks professional 

- Establish an online presence with the goal being one of the first options that comes up in the browser search

### User Stories

#### Navbar

- As a user, when logo is clicked, I am redirected to the video with the banner. 

- As a user, when I click the menu links in the Navbar, I will be redirected to another section in the page.

- As a user, when I click the "Contact" page, a popup modal form will appear allowing me to still remain on the site.

#### Main sections

- As a user, when the map markers are clicked I see an overview of the country.

- As a user, when I click the images on the bottom, another window opens up showing me that particular page while still allowing me to
see and access the page I was on.

- As a user, when the accordion is clicked I will see an overview of what is going to happen for each day of the trip.

#### Footer

- As a user, when I click on the email link in the footer, a popup-modal appears with the contact form.

- As a user, when I click on the social links, another window opens up with that particular page allowing me to still see the page I
was on.

- As a user, when email or content in contact form is left blank, an error message appears.

- As a user, when the subscribe field is clicked an error message will appear until a valid email is written. When a valid email has 
been written, button will appear saying Subscribe. After clicking button, field will be empty and button will change color and show 
subscribed.

- As a user, when the itinerary buttons are clicked, the menu will dropdown. When clicked again the button will collapse.

### Wireframes
These are the wireframes that I used in this project. This was the initial draft, but the outcome of the website have a few differences.

### Features Left to Implement

10. <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a>

## Testing



1. HTML validator
    - I tested the validation of my HTML with an HTML validator and recieved 1 parse error from one of my links located in the head section. I managed to fix this error by replacing "style" with "type".

### Bugs and solutions

1. The video wasn't showing well on mobile devices so I decided therefore to replace it with an image instead. 

2. When clicking the first button of the accordion the "subscribed" background and text appears. 

<img src="assets/media/bugs/accordion.png">

I managed to fix this by removing the javascript script source from the bottom of the page.

3. When viewing the main page on a mobile device there is some white space on the right hand side. I fixed this by adjusting the margins in media query for mobile view.

- At the start of this project I researched mission websites as well as holiday destination websites to gain some inspiration for the layout
I would want as well as what type of content I should implement. Most of my inspiration came from <a href="https://www.cru.org/">CRU</a> 
and <a href="https://www.exotravel.com/">EXO Travel</a>.
