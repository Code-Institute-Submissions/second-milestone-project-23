# MOVEMENT

It's part of our human nature to want to explore the world that we live in. Most people go on holiday abroad at least once a year. 
Those who are single or retired travel even more. That is no different for us christians. Most christians have at some point in their 
life wanted to go on a mission trip. Some people want to just experience the life of a missionary as a one off thing and see the work of 
somebody they are either supporting or have heard about, others want to try it out and see if the missionary lifestyle is for them or not 
and if it's something that God has called them to do. 

In this project I've created a website that provides services like this, where individuals/couples/families can experience life in the 
mission field all from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. 

## UX

The website offers different kinds of mission trips depending on what the individual/couple/family is looking for as well as for how long 
they want to go for. There are four different destinations being offered with different trip lengths as well as different types of trips. 
This website targets everyone from creative people who want to use dance and drama as a missions platform; youth groups looking to do work
with other youths or young children, and those who are interested in going around preaching and giving testimonies in different churches.


### Business Goals 

- To gain an increase in website user activity, online enquiries and direct contact with the company

- To provide an easy navigational website for all kinds of users, that is clear and looks professional 

- Establish an online presence with the goal being one of the first options that comes up in the browser search

### User Stories

see and access the page I was on.
